# Medical Appointment No Shows

## About Dataset
This dataset includes 110k medical appointments and contains 14 associated characteristics. The most important one for this project is if the patient showed up to their appointment or not.

I will be cleaning, exploring, and giving my thoughts on what the data tells us regarding the possibility to predict if a patient will show up to their appointment based off a few factors.
